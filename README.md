# LocalFestival_SuccFaillAnalysis

## üíª Project Introduction
<Analysis of Success Factors and Clustering of Nationwide Regional Festivals>
  
- Profiling festival clusters based on success factors and proposing improvement plans
  
- Project Period: July 2023 ~ September 2023

## ü´∂ Team Composition
Kim Dong-hwan (Team Leader), Kim Min, Seo Yoo-jin, Lee Soo-rin, Jang Da-yeon

## üîç Analysis Workflow

1. Data Collection<br>
2. Data Preprocessing and Merging (Reclassification of Festival Types)
3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
4. Identification of Success Factors (based on feature importance with 'visitors/budget' as the dependent variable)
5. Clustering Festivals Based on Key Success Factors (using KMedoids) (distinguishing success/failure clusters based on 'visitors/budget' and 'average daily visitors')
6. Profiling Characteristics and Key Visitors of Each Festival Cluster
7. Proposing Improvement Plans for Failed Festival Clusters (based on commonalities and differences with successful clusters)

#### Analysis of Successful Festival Clusters
- <"Strike While the Iron is Hot" (Cluster 1)>: Cluster of festivals held in popular tourist regions such as Gangwon, Busan, and Jeju (e.g., Chuncheon Mime Festival, Gangneung Coffee Festival), where visitors often also attend regional festivals.
- <"Even the View of Mount Geumgang After a Meal" (Cluster 2)>: Cluster of festivals themed around 'specialty products' in regions outside the metropolitan area (e.g., Imsil N Cheese Festival, Suncheon Soybean Festival), primarily attracting middle-aged visitors with the highest festival sales in all aspects.
- <"Taste and Style for the 2030s" (Cluster 3)>: Cluster of festivals themed around 'culture and arts' held in metropolitan cities (e.g., Daegu Chimac Festival, Incheon Pentaport Rock Festival), with high sales in the retail sector.
#### Improvement Plans for Failed Festival Clusters
- <Enhancing Festival Appeal!>: Cluster of festivals held in the metropolitan area (Seoul, Gyeonggi) (e.g., Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival, Siheung Gaetgol Festival). They should benchmark Cluster 1, which attracts visitors despite the festival not being the main destination.
  1. Promote or collaborate with landmarks (department stores, parks, leisure facilities, etc.) around the festival venue to attract nearby visitors.
  2. Establish a clear festival identity to enhance recognition and generate revenue through efficient budget management.

- <Things to See, Do, and Buy!>: Cluster of festivals themed around 'tradition' (e.g., Ansan Baudeogi Festival, Eumseong Pumba Festival), with a primary audience of the 50s and 60s, sharing commonalities with Cluster 2. They should benchmark the success factors of Cluster 2.
  1. Increase recognition of the festival by linking 'tradition,' the festival's theme, with related 'specialty products,' stimulating the interest and spending power of the primary visitors in their 50s and 60s.
  2. Like the festivals in Cluster 2, consider renaming the festival to be more intuitive.
